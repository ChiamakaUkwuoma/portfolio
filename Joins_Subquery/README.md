# SQL JOINS QUERY

This is a simple task to understand the SQL JOINS query. This task is to write a SQL query that works with a simple dataset of 5 .csv files. The dataset is a simplified version of the data you might see in a real database. The dataset is summed up in 5 `.csv` files, which are:

1. `q1.csv` - a table of orders for books.
2. `q2.csv` - a table of authors and revenue per author.
3. `q3.csv` - a table of customers and their orders.
4. `q4.csv` - a table of customers and their order dates.
5. `q5.csv` - a table of authors, their revenue, and ratings for thier works.

All the data can be seen within the `bookstore.sqlite` file.
